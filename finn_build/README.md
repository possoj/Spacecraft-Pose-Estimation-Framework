# FINN Build Folder

The intermediate build folders generated by **FINN** are not stored on GitHub due to file size limitations.  
They are optional and only needed if you want to directly inspect the build artifacts without regenerating them.

ðŸ‘‰ [Download intermediate FINN build folders on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17137746)  

If needed, download and extract the `finn_build.zip` archive into the root of this repository.
