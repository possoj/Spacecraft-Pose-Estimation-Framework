# Spacecraft Pose Estimation Framework (SPEF)

The **Spacecraft Pose Estimation Framework (SPEF)** is an open-source toolkit for **training, quantizing, and deploying deep neural networks** for spacecraft pose estimation from monocular images and video sequences.

SPEF has been developed in the context of a Ph.D. thesis and an upcoming IEEE TAES journal publication. It supports **real-time embedded implementations** on **CPU**, **GPU (NVIDIA Jetson)**, and **FPGA**, and includes utilities for **dataset generation**, **temporal evaluation**, and **visualization**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Pose Estimation Training**
- **Quantization (QAT)**:
  - **Brevitas + FINN** for FPGA
  - **PyTorch FX** for CPU
  - **pytorch-quantization-toolkit** for NVIDIA Jetson GPU
- **Embedded Deployment**:
  - CPU with TVM
  - GPU (Jetson) with TensorRT
  - FPGA (Xilinx UltraScale+) with FINN
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for real-time pose visualization
- **Dataset Generation Tools** for D-SPEED dataset creation

## 📦 Installation (via Docker)

All installations are handled via Dockerfiles located in the `setup/` directory. Please refer to the individual README files in `setup/` for detailed build instructions and preparation steps for each target platform (**CPU**, **Jetson GPU**, and **FPGA**).

---

## 💾 Pretrained Models and Experiments

The pretrained models and experimental results are hosted on Zenodo due to file size limitations.  

👉 [Download from Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17137746)  

Contents on Zenodo:  
- **models/**: pretrained neural network weights and checkpoints, evaluation metrics, configuration files, and annotated 3D keypoints of the *Tango* spacecraft.  
- **experiments/**: training logs, model compilation outputs, embedded execution metrics, temporal filtering experiments, and ablation studies on probabilistic encoding (soft classification).  
- **finn_build/** *(optional)*: intermediate build folders generated by **FINN**. These are not required for running experiments, but can be useful if you want to directly inspect the build artifacts without regenerating them.

## 🛠 Usage

### 1. Training (Brevitas docker image)
Before launching training, go to `src/config/train/` and create your YAML configuration files:
- For **Brevitas models (QAT)** with mixed precision: create a folder `exp_X` (e.g., `exp_0`, `exp_1`) containing the YAML configuration file and JSON bit-width file.
- For **PyTorch models (Float32)**: create a single file `exp_X.yaml` (e.g., `exp_1.yaml`).

Training results will be stored in `experiments/train/`.
```bash
python train.py
```

### 2. Model Building (Use the corresponding Docker image for each target platform)
**GPU/CPU build pipeline**: 🎯 QAT → 🛠️ Compile → 📊 Evaluate → 💾 Store results:
- **GPU (NVIDIA)**: `build_nvidia.py` → configs in `src/build/nvidia/` → results in `experiments/build/nvidia/`
- **CPU (TVM)**: `build_tvm.py` → configs in `src/build/tvm/` → results in `experiments/build/tvm/`

**FPGA build pipeline** (QAT must be run manually with the Brevitas Docker image — see Step 1): 🛠️ Compile → 💾 Store results :
- **FPGA (FINN)**: `build_finn.py` → configs in `src/build/finn/` → results in `experiments/build/finn/`

> For more details about the FPGA implementation, please refer to our dedicated repository: **[FPGA-SpacePose](https://github.com/possoj/FPGA-SpacePose)**

### 3. Deployment (Use the corresponding Docker image for each target platform)
Deployment is automatic.  
Make sure to follow the steps in the `setup/` directory to configure the board (install OS, libraries, etc.).  
Adapt the **IP address**, **port**, **username**, and **password** in `src/boards/boards_cfg.py` according to your setup.

Then run the corresponding deployment script:
- **CPU (TVM)**: `deploy_cpu.py`  
- **GPU (NVIDIA)**: `deploy_nvidia.py`  
- **FPGA (FINN)**: `deploy_fpga.py`

**Note — selecting the experiment to deploy**  
When running `deploy_cpu.py` (same for `deploy_nvidia.py` / `deploy_fpga.py`), the script will prompt you for the **experiment** to deploy. This corresponds to the folder created during the *build* phase, e.g.:  
- TVM: `experiments/build/tvm/<run_id>`  
- NVIDIA: `experiments/build/nvidia/<run_id>`  
- FINN: `experiments/build/finn/<run_id>`  

### 4. Additional Tools
- `temporal.py`: Evaluate on temporal D-SPEED data → results in `experiments/temporal/`
- `nn_stats.py`: Print per-layer network statistics (MACs, parameters)
- `soft_class_plot.py`: Evaluate soft-classification encoding/decoding impact on pose accuracy → results in `experiments/soft_classification/`

### 5. GUI
```bash
xhost +
python gui.py
```
If the Jetson board has been configured and is reachable from the host computer (see Step 3 — Deployment), you can also deploy to it directly through the GUI.
